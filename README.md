// Project Description

Starting with a Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set, there was a need to increase some of the data and randomize columns to allow for more robust data analysis. 

I utilized Pandas to clean and reorganize the data. The data was then loaded into PostgreSQL. Several queries were completed and downloaded to csv that were used as the Tableau source files to create Visualizations. 

1. emp_hourlydemo
2. employee_salary_demo
3. emp_satisfaction
4. emp_sources
5. temp_emp

After downloading the csvs, Tableau spreedsheets were created. There comparisons completed between hourly/salary populaton and gender/race. Additional comparisons between Employee Engagement and Satisdaction based on race and each department. 

// ROADBLOCKS
* Lack of access to real data to create the model. Even an absence of really complete datasets for hypothetical models
